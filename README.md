# Medicament Calendrier
This simple program returns the end date of medicaments relied on quantity and utilisations. It have been programmed using Python programming language with OOP Diagram to make the code more customizable. 
I have also used datetime package to calculate the time difference within the script, and sqlite package to store date in a database.
